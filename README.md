# Facial Emotion Recognition

This app detects facial emotions through live-capture via the your phone's camera. This was done through utilizing Tensorflow and Keras to build the conventional neural network, React Native for the camera and front-end, and Node and Express for the server requests and backend.

## How to Use

The camera will auto-capture once a face is detected for three consecutive seconds, then the picture will be sent to the Node server where the prediction will be made.
